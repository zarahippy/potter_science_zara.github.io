    <p class="pb">Before you read this, I would like to remind you that this inclination will be more of a historical than a scientifical (yes, i know that history has not much to do with science, but you cannot miss this fact!).</p>
    <p class="pb">"Merlin's Beard!"-the famous swearing word in Harry Potter. It was based upon a Wizard named Merlin. Merlin is known in the world pf Harry Potter as THE LEGEND. He was even greater than Dumbledore!
    Merlin was a legendary British wizard who lived during the Middle Ages. Little is known of his past, but he was a member of King Arthur's court, and one of the most famous wizard of all time.
    But far before Rowling, the name of a Great Wizard called Merlin was first to announce by Geoffrey of Monmouth in the early 12th century. 
    Merlin first came to our world by the two first books Geoffrey wrote called Historia Regum Britanniae (the "History of the Kings of Britain") and Vita Merlini ("Merlin's Life").
    The story from Geoffrey was adapted from the Celtic mythology. Alas, when it comes to myths, the fact about whether Merlin lived or not is a vague point.
    Nonetheless, a Historian known as Geoffrey Ashe* wrote about how Geoffrey of Monmouth connected the ending of his King Arthur's series by connecting it with the tail end of the Roman Empire.
    Before we talk more about Merlin, why don't we dig up a little bit about Monmouth's main character: King Arthur? King Arthur was known by people in the middle ages, but how about his real life role model?
    The figures of King Arthur based on legendary Kings are believed to come from before the Fall of Rome. What about Merlin? Merlin was known to the series also in an archaic age.
    The ages Merlin lived would probably had been taken from myths far before fall of Rome.
    However, the possibilities of a real life legend called Merlin were not that hazy.
    A poem from the A.D. 600 claimed about a Welsh prophet named Myrddin which throughout the years may have been mispelled to Merlin.
    And accordingly the Merlin prototype was perhaps taken by a Celtic figure called Lailoken who gained a second sight and ran away to live in the forest.
    But by far the fact by Nicolas Tolstoy is the one that states: "...Merlin was indeed an historical figure, living in what are now the lowlands of Scotland at the end of the sixth century A.D...an authentic prophet, most likely a druid surviving in a pagan enclave of the north."
    Even madder though, a new Biography stated if Merlin was actually the King living in Northern England (and mate, this narrative actually deviates too much from the idea of Merlin itself).
    People were crazy about finding the real Merlin, even some Historians go crazy when they talked about the scottish roots of this Welsh Wizard. But sometimes- have you ever wondered if Geoffrey of Monmouth was just as creative as Rowling when he created those legendary characters?
    Oh well, let time and researches tell. And at the very least, you now know the tip edge of the "MERLIN'S BEARD!" swearing origin.
