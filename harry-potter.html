      <P class="pa" style="text-align: center;">Did you know his most sweetful sayings?</P>
      <p class="pb">Sweetful, as in heart-breaking too. The boy who lived, who survived the Killing Curse twice,
          the boy who felt so much loss and misery in such a young age. Who else is this boy than our beloved Harry Potter?
          Harry is known for his scar and the distinctive features of his round glasses and his messy brown hair.
          He is a part of the Golden Trio with Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.
          Harry however, is part of the most underrated character in Harry Potter.
