      <h1 class="Heading1">The Invisibility Cloak is Not Fictious??? (This Text is Invisible)</h1>
      <p class="pb">The invisivility Cloak had its fake goods even in the magic world. But what if there is also a similar fake in real life? Or maybe, there'll be a cloak with the same good invisibility as the real one as well?
          According to the newest science technology, the invisibility cloak might work in the future-near after all!
          Well, well- who does not reckon this cool cloak? It would be dumb to not want to have it.
          Now, is it possible for us to have it?
          A team of scientists have successfully cloaked an object into the state of invisible with broadband light, using a new technique named, “spectral cloaking.”
        They used fibre optic cable, laser light and a target object at the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS) in Montreal for their experiment.
        They said that it looked transparently like a ghost. As in its covers were completely covering the object's bod.
        But what could possibly make an object invisible?
        You see, most light sources in the world, including the sun, emit a range of visible light waves. Light sources usually emits the colour wave of white, but with the help of a prism, we can celarly divide light into various colour waves.
        Objects in everyday life are visible to the naked eye when they reflect and absorb a portion of this broadband light.
        The trick is the eye, our vision can see because the help of light. However, the color that came to our sight is no other than the light wave colour that bounced out of our vision.
        With this invention that keeps improving, the invisibility cloak might be on sale on the nearest store to you soon!
