        <p class="pc">Lunaa, who doesn't love her? She's just that sweet character you could never come to not love, even if you try not to (you would be dumb to be trying anyway).
          This is her line from The Order of The Phoenix. It was her first line as a character. Luna always had a unique character, and he was one of the friends who fought along with Harry. A genius witch and a faithful friend.
        Luna always seemed to find the way out for Harry, just similar as Hermione.
