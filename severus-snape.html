    <h1 class="Heading1">The Half-blood Prince's Server</h1>
    <P class="pa" style="text-align: center;">Did you know his most powerful sayings?</P>
    <p class="pb">Severus Snape is known as one of the honorable professors in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Professor Snape's teaching major is potion, (that's real science, mates!).
        Although in the sixth book and movie, it was revealed from Snape's own quote that he is the half-blood prince who created the Sectum-Sempra spell. He looks and acts both fierce and emotionless,
    which made most of his students think that this Professor is quite scary. Nevertheless, Snape hides a painful and aching memory deep inside, which made him a dark character.
Snape was bullied by the Marauder themselves, and his love of live married the man who bullied him the most. Snape was also hated by most of his fans for his behaviour and actions of killing the great
Dumbledore himself. However, this half-blood prince deserve better than those judgments. He is still a soft gentleman who helps Harry when Harry needed him the most. Here are some favourite "sweet" lines of our Professor Snape!</p>

<div class="quotes">

    <h4>
1. "Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair."
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p>This quote of his popped up in Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire both in the books and its movies. 
    This is a real life experience that Severus Snape had to pass through too. 
    Like we stated, Snape was the most misunderstood characterin the world of Harry Potter. </p>
